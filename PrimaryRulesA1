Part 3: Turns
Step 1, select a unit to activate
Step 2, Use as many of the General and Attack actions as you desire

Part 4: Attacks
Step 0, Melee Attack Actions can only target units within 1 inch.
Step 1, Compare the Attack Actions Attack stat with the defending Unit's Defensive stat. Use Dodge for 
        Ranged Attacks and Block for Melee attacks. Roll a D6 and determine the result as listed bellow
  1A, If the Attack is equal to double the Defensive stat then a roll of 2 or greater is a successful attack.
  1B, If the Attack is greater then the Defensive stat but less then double the defensive stat then a roll of 
      3 or greater is a successful attack
  1C, If the Attack is equal to the Defensive stat then a roll of 4 or greater is successful Attack
  1D, If the Attack is less then the Defensive stat but greater then half the Defensive stat (Round up) then a 
      roll of 5 or greater is a successful attack
  1E, If the Attack is equal to or less then half the Defensive stat (Round up) then a roll of 6 or greater is 
      a successful attack
  1D, If none of the attacks from this action are successful then exit the Attack step
Step 2, If the attack is successful then your opponent rolls a D6 and compares it to their Armor stat after 
        subtracting any Piercing from the attack. If the Defender rolls equal to or Higher then the result, 
        exit the attack step
Step 3, Apply damage to the unit according to the damage of the attack
  3A, If the unit contains more then one model, the defender chooses which model takes the damage
  3B, If a model already has 1 or more damage on it, but not more damage then it's health, the defender must 
      choose that model
  3C, if a model has damage on it equal to or greater then the Health stat of the model, that model must be 
      removed at the end of the attack action.
  3D, if an Attack Action has multiple attacks, apply damage one attack at a time.
  3E, Damage from any attack may only hit one model, even if that damage exceeds the health of the model.
